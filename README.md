# Coding-Problems

This repository is a collection of solutions, written by me, of problems given by the book 'Daily Coding Problem' by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu.
The first word of the file, i.e. 'Array' is the chapter and the type of problems covered.
The first number is which problem in the chapter it is, i.e. 'Array1' is the first problem in the Array Chapter.
The second number is what attempt or the order of solutions on the problem, i.e. 'Array1_1' was my first attempt at answering the problem,
and 'Array1_2' is my second attempt at answering the problem. Typically, after my first attempt I will look up their given solution and then redo the problem.
